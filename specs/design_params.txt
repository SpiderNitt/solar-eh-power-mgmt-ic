Design Parameters for the Solar Energy Harvester PMIC

Under Infinite Input Power Assumption:
	Switch Matrix:
		- L = 2mH (boost conv. inductor)
		- Ip = 1mA (peak inductor current)
		- C = 3uF (load capacitor)
		- R = 40k (load resistance)
		- Obtained timing parameters for above design: Least is 2.2us (tphi2), max is 83us (tempty)
